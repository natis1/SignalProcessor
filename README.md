# SignalProcessor
Generic Signal Processor

# What is this?

Signal processor is a very small program I wrote to generate and analyze entropy in strings. It was written for a class and has no practical functionaily outside of it.

Todo: Rewrite the main function to allow the user to either generate or analyze.


I think I put more effort into this readme than the processor itself. I got an A on the project so it did its job.
